# My NvChad Configuration
## THE "nvim" FOLDER IS PLACED INTO "AppData\Local\"

This repository contains my personal configuration for **NvChad**, built on top of the official NvChad framework.  

> **Note:** This setup is meant for users familiar with NvChad. The main NvChad repository is used as a dependency, so this repo mainly serves as a configuration layer.
